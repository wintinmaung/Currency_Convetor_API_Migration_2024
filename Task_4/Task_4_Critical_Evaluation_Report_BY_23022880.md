# Task-4_Critical_Evaluation_Report_BY_23022880_TIN_MAUNG_WIN_UFCFX3-15-3 - Advanced_topics_in_web_development_1
## Learning Outcomes while working on this assignment
A lot of knowledge like microservices and its principles, the structure of XML and Document Object Model (DOM) and its processing, fetching data from API had been learnt while working on this project although I have some kind of knowledge and syntax of using php, html and javascript and how they work.

1. **XML Manipulation**: Learning to create and manipulate XML documents using the `DOMDocument` class in PHP and Reading the content  or adding, removing, or modifing elements, attributes, or their values within parsed XML documents using APIs provided by `simplexml_load_file`.
2. **API Request**: If the API request is successful, return the specificed currencies.Otherwise, an error message is displayed, and the script exits by using the reques details including *api_url, access_key, end points, base_currency, currencies which want to be fetched*.
3. **Error Handling**: Improving error handling techniques to detect and handle API request failures and decoding errors and Understand how to handle errors and exceptions during AJAX requests to ensure smooth user experience and error recovery on the interface page. For example, Response Handling by using event handlers such as `xhr.onload` and `xhr.onerror`.
4. **External Data Integration**: Getting experience in fetching and processing data from external APIs and integrating it with local data sources. For example, `$dom->save('data/rates.xml');`, `$xml->asXML('../data/rates.xml');`.
5. **XMLHttpRequest Object**: Familiarizing with the XMLHttpRequest object, which is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the server. For example, Making HTTP requests in javaScript using using the `XMLHttpRequest` and object (`xhr`), Error handling by using `xhr.onerror`, understanding the form submission behavior of `event.preventDefault()` method, making to ensure uniqueness by (`set`) while populatig dropdown menu.
6. **DOM Manipulation**: Learning how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page dynamically in response to server data, enabling updates without page reloads. For example, Retrieving element by its unique attribute by using `document.getElementById('currencyForm)`, return the first element by `document.querySelector('')`, 
7. **XPath Syntax and its Note Selection** : Learning how to construct XPath predicates to filter nodes based on specific criteria, navigate through an XML document using XPath and Differentiate between node types (element, attribute, text, etc.) and select them accordingly. For example, Trying to get the currency_code Name from (`../date/list-one.xml`) flie by using (`$name = $xmlplace->xpath("//ISO_4217/CcyTbl/CcyNtry[Ccy='".$currency_code."']/CcyNm")`). 


## How the application I might have built be extended and improved
From my point of view, there would be several ways to develop this project like functionality, usability and user experience by adding some additional features of the responsive web pages as actual exchange sites. eg. [Eurochange](www.eurochange.co.uk), [No1_currency](www.no1currency.com). Data visualization tools like line graph using javascript to provided increased or decreased rate of each currency based on the time along with currencies locations. Providing the descriptive respond messages to users with pop-up message boxes while they are conducting currency exchange. Error handling from both sides of application like client and server and making responsive design for various devices and browsers. 
If this project is approching as actual working website, we should add the following features and functions.
1. Having session logics for users like login/ signup page, 
2. Defining the roles of admins for actions, 
3. Adding more currencies, 
4. Desiging better customized layouts,  
5. Encoding url rather than paramters and data encryption to straighten security, 
6. Providing Manual or Documentation for end-users, developers, admins
7. Mantaining and monitoring regularly.



## How the application and/ or its components could promote re-use
In this project, there is two main components as client view and admin view like converting rates of currency and making actions of post, put, del by using AJAX requests. So that, there are `index.php`, `function_index.php`, `updatexml.php`, `config.php`, `rates.php` had been stored in order to perform currency exchange function from client side whereas `index.php`, `Action_function.php`, `Action_function.php` are stored in update folder for admin side. Data files like `rates.xml` and `list-one.xml` are saved in data folder. Mostly function files can be reused in other projects becasue they contain public functions, respective data of each currencies to generate and work together such as functions like  `convertCurrency();` , `fetchNewRateFromAPI();`, `fetchOldRateFromAPI();`, `handleError();` and `generateError();`. `Index.php` from both sides can also re-used with better responsive design and providing the same required parameters to run. Data files would be used if the other projects which are using the same or similar XML structures and data handling. If fetching data from API request and saving in XML formatted files, `Rate.php` and `updatexml.php` can be used to generate the required data files and new data would be fetched again if the file is more than 2 hours old. If they are saving the same names of local XML files, they can also reuse the function like `fetchNameFromXML();`, `fetchLocFromXML();`, `fetchCodeFromXML();`, `fetchPlaceFromXML()` to get data from local files.  The main file containing the main keys like access_key, and error messages with definations can also be used by declaring that file. eg. `include '../config.php'` / `include_once '../config.php'` / `require '../config.php'`/ `require_once '../config.php'`.
